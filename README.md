I'm a software developer, mostly focused on backend and system development, as well as infrastructure management and architecture.
I started with 20 years ago, with HTML/CSS, then JavaScript and PHP. Dabled in Java and Go, and re-focused on cross platform C/C++. Nowadays, I mainly work with Typescript/Node.js and Python.

I'm hugely interested in self-hosted and open-source software.
